This module adds Mozilla Persona functionality to your site.
Users will be able to login and create an account using this system.
By using Persona to log in, a user does not need a password to log
into your site, the authentication is done by Persona.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Simply install the module, and the Persona login link will be added to the
login/register form. You can easily create your own Persona link by giving
any element a class of 'persona-sign-in'.

You can make any element end the Persona session and logout the Drupal
user by having a class of 'persona-sign-out' on an element.

Currently, the default Drupal login/logout system work properly using Persona.

You have the option of allowing users to register via Persona as well.
This means when someone tries to log into the site, and they don't have an
account, Persona will generate an account for them automatically.

This module depends on the Session API module.
